QuickBooks for Communards
#########################

QuickBooks for Communards is a web application built specifically for
non-Accountant communards, consisting of an Elm frontend and a Haskell API
server that communicates with QuickBooks Desktop using the `QuickBooks
WebConnector`_.

The frontend presents Communards with transaction logs for relevant Accounts as
well as forms for entering their Credit Card purchases, Trip entries, or
Transfers.

This is still in the alpha stage, but under active development.
